# Settings: Customize Your Experience

The **Settings** page is where you can tailor the Signal Gen application to fit your workflow and preferences. It's divided into several key sections, allowing you to manage everything from the visual theme to your API keys.

---

## Appearance

Customize the look and feel of the application to match your style.

-   **Color Mode:** Switch between a classic **Dark** theme, ideal for most trading environments, and a clean **Light** theme.
-   **Accent Color:** Personalize your UI by choosing an accent color that will be used for highlights, buttons, and important indicators throughout the app.

## AI Assistant

Fine-tune the behavior of your AI co-pilot.

-   **Contextual Awareness:** When enabled, this allows the AI Assistant to see what page you are on and what data you are viewing (e.g., an active signal). This enables it to provide highly relevant, context-specific answers. It is highly recommended to keep this on for the best experience.
-   **Enable Function Calling:** This is a powerful feature that allows the AI to trigger actions within the app based on your commands (e.g., "Generate a signal for me"). If you prefer the AI to only provide information and not perform actions, you can disable this.
-   **Chat Icon:** Choose from several icons to personalize the floating chat button.
-   **Clear Chat History:** This button will permanently delete all your saved conversations with the AI Assistant. Use this if you want to clear your history for privacy or to start fresh.

## Preferences

Manage general application behaviors.

-   **Audio Alerts:** When enabled, the application will play distinct sound notifications for important events, such as when a new AI signal is generated or when a live trade hits a Take Profit or Stop Loss target.
-   **Cloud Sync:** (Future Feature) This will allow you to sync your settings, trade logs, and strategies to the cloud, making them accessible across different devices.

## Exchange API Keys

This section is for connecting the application to your exchange accounts for simulated trade execution and enhanced data fetching.

**🔒 Security is Paramount:**
-   Your API keys are stored **exclusively in your browser's local storage**. They are never sent to or stored on our servers.
-   For all features in this application, it is **highly recommended to use Testnet API keys** or keys with restricted permissions (e.g., read-only access for data, trade-only for execution simulation) for maximum security.

**How to Use:**
1.  **Select Exchange:** Choose the exchange (e.g., Bybit, Binance) you want to configure from the dropdown menu.
2.  **Enter Keys:** Carefully paste your API Key and API Secret into the respective fields. The inputs are masked for security.
3.  **Automatic Saving:** The keys are saved automatically as you type, indicated by a "Saved" status next to the label.
