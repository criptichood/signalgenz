# News: Your AI-Curated Market Feed

In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, staying informed is critical. The **News** page is your intelligent, AI-curated feed that cuts through the noise and delivers the market information that matters most.

Unlike a standard news aggregator, this page leverages the power of the Gemini API to provide an extra layer of analysis on every story.

## How It Works

Our backend system continuously fetches headlines from top-tier cryptocurrency news sources. For each article, a process is triggered that uses the **Google Gemini API** to perform two key tasks:

1.  **Sentiment Analysis:** The AI reads the article and determines the overall sentiment of the news. Is it bullish for the market, bearish, or neutral? This sentiment is then displayed with a clear visual indicator.
    -   <span style="color: #4ade80;">**Bullish (▲):**</span> Positive news, such as new partnerships, technological breakthroughs, or favorable market conditions.
    -   <span style="color: #f87171;">**Bearish (▼):**</span> Negative news, such as regulatory crackdowns, security breaches, or poor market performance.
    -   <span style="color: #fbbf24;">**Neutral (—):**</span> Factual or informative news without a strong positive or negative bias.

2.  **Categorization:** The AI identifies the main topic of the article and assigns it to a relevant category, such as `Market Analysis`, `Regulation`, `DeFi`, `Technology`, or `Ecosystem`. This allows you to quickly gauge the nature of the news at a glance.

## Using the Feed

-   **Layout:** The page is designed for easy reading, with the most significant or recent story featured prominently at the top, followed by a grid of other articles.
-   **Search:** Use the search bar at the top to instantly filter the feed for news related to a specific topic, keyword, or cryptocurrency (e.g., "Solana," "ETF," "regulation").
-   **Read More:** Clicking on any news card will open the original article in a new tab, allowing you to read the full story directly from the source.
-   **Infinite Scroll:** As you scroll down, the "Load More News" button allows you to progressively load older articles from the archive.
