# AI Signal History: Your Trading Journal

The **AI Signal History** page is a comprehensive, automated journal of every trade signal generated by the application, whether from the **Signal Gen** page or the **Scalping** interface. This powerful tool allows you to review past performance, learn from historical data, and backtest your strategies.

## The History Table

All your past signals are organized in a detailed table with the following columns:

-   **Symbol:** The cryptocurrency pair for the signal.
-   **Generated:** How long ago the signal was created.
-   **Type:** The origin of the signal (`Swing` from Signal Gen or `Scalp` from Scalping).
-   **Direction:** Whether the trade idea was `LONG` or `SHORT`.
-   **Entry / TP / SL:** The core price levels of the trade setup.
-   **Status:** The current outcome of the signal.

### Interactive Status Updates

The **Status** column is interactive. You can click on the badge to manually update the outcome of a trade. This is crucial for accurate performance tracking in your **Analytics** dashboard. The statuses include:
-   **Pending:** The default state for a new signal.
-   **Win:** The trade hit one or more of its Take Profit targets. The badge will show which TPs were hit (e.g., "Win (TP 2)").
-   **Loss:** The trade hit its Stop Loss.
-   **Closed:** You manually closed the trade before it hit either TP or SL.

### Filtering and Sorting

For easy navigation, you can filter your entire history by **symbol**, **status**, or **signal type**. You can also sort any column by clicking on its header.

## Actions: Turning History into Insight

The "Actions" column for each signal provides powerful tools to reuse and analyze past data:

-   **Simulate:** This is one of the most powerful features for backtesting. Clicking "Simulate" will take the parameters of that historical signal and create a new setup on the **Simulation** page. You can then "replay" the market from the moment the signal was generated to see exactly how it would have performed.
-   **Restore View:** This action navigates you back to the appropriate page (`Signal Gen` or `Scalping`) and pre-fills the entire controls panel with the exact parameters that were used to generate that signal. This is incredibly useful for re-analyzing a past setup with new market data or tweaking a successful strategy.
-   **Delete:** Permanently removes the signal from your history.

By combining a detailed log with powerful analytical actions, the History page transforms from a simple list into an essential tool for learning and strategy refinement.
