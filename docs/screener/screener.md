# AI Market Screener: Find Your Next Trade with Words

The **AI Market Screener** is a powerful tool that transforms the way you find trading opportunities. Instead of manually clicking through dozens of charts, you can simply ask Gemini to scan the market for you using plain, natural English.

This page allows you to describe the exact technical analysis setup you're looking for, and the AI will return a list of assets that match your criteria.

## How It Works

The workflow is simple and intuitive:

1.  **Describe Your Ideal Setup:** In the main text area, type a description of the trade you want to find. Be as specific or as general as you like. The more detail you provide, the more refined the results will be.

2.  **Get Inspired (Optional):** If you're not sure what to ask, the screener will automatically cycle through a list of example queries to give you ideas. You can click on any suggestion to instantly populate the text box.

3.  **Scan the Market:** Click the **"Scan Market"** button. The application will send your query to the Gemini AI, which will analyze a pre-defined list of top cryptocurrencies for matching patterns.

4.  **Review the Results:** The results of your scan will appear in a new card below. Each card represents a historical scan and contains one or more matching assets. For each asset found, the AI will provide:
    -   **Symbol:** The cryptocurrency that matches your query.
    -   **Rationale:** A concise explanation from the AI detailing *why* this asset was selected.

## Example Queries

You can ask the AI almost anything related to technical analysis. Here are a few examples to get you started:

-   *"Find trending assets that are currently overbought on the 4-hour RSI."*
-   *"Show me coins with a bullish market structure that are pulling back to a key support level."*
-   *"Which assets have the highest volume spike in the last hour?"*
-   *"Find coins showing bullish divergence on the daily chart."*
-   *"Which assets are forming a golden cross (50MA over 200MA) on the 4H timeframe?"*

## Acting on the Results

Once the AI finds a potential opportunity, you can act on it immediately. Each result card has two action buttons:

-   **Signal Gen:** Clicking this will take you to the **Signal Gen** page and automatically trigger a deep, AI-powered swing trade analysis for that specific symbol.
-   **Scalping:** Clicking this will navigate you to the **Scalping** interface and initiate a high-frequency scalping signal analysis for that symbol.

This seamless integration allows you to move from a high-level market scan to a detailed, actionable trade idea in just a couple of clicks.

## Scan History

Every scan you run is saved to your history on the page. You can review past results, see which queries were most effective, and delete old scans to keep your workspace clean. You can also use the search bar to filter your history by the query you used.
