# Manual Studio: Your Personal Trade Blueprint

The **Manual Studio**, accessible via "Man Signal" in the sidebar, is your personal workspace for crafting, analyzing, and validating your own trade ideas. Unlike the Signal Gen page where the AI creates the plan, here *you* are the analyst, and the AI acts as your expert co-pilot, providing a "second opinion" to refine your strategy before you commit.

This page is perfect for traders who have their own strategies but want the added confidence of an AI review.

## The Workflow: From Idea to Tracked Signal

The process is designed to be intuitive, moving from initial idea to a live-tracked signal.

### Step 1: Build Your Trade Blueprint

The **Manual Controls** panel on the left is where you define every aspect of your trade idea.

-   **Core Setup:** Define the `Symbol`, `Timeframe`, and `Direction` (Long/Short) of your trade.
-   **Trade Levels:** Precisely enter your desired `Entry` price, `Stop Loss`, and up to three `Take Profit` targets. As you type, these levels will automatically be drawn on the main price chart for visual confirmation.
-   **Risk Management:** Input your desired `Margin` ($) and `Leverage`. The **Calculated Blueprint** section will instantly update to show you crucial risk metrics based on your inputs, including:
    -   **Position Size:** The total value of your position.
    -   **Risk Amount:** The exact dollar amount you stand to lose if your Stop Loss is hit.
    -   **R:R (TP1):** The risk-to-reward ratio for your first target.
    -   **Profit at TP1:** The potential profit if your first target is reached.
-   **Trade Context:** Add your own `Reasoning` for the trade. This is crucial for your journal and for giving the AI context.

### Step 2: Get an AI Second Opinion

Once you have defined your trade levels, the **Manual Signal Card** will appear on the dashboard. This is where the magic happens.

-   Click the **"Analyze My Idea"** button.
-   The application will send your complete trade idea (entry, SL, TPs) along with recent market data to the Gemini AI.
-   The AI will analyze your setup and return its expert feedback, which includes:
    -   **Confidence Score:** A percentage (0-100%) indicating the AI's confidence in your plan's probability of success.
    -   **Rationale:** A detailed analysis of the pros and cons of your setup from the AI's perspective.
    -   **Suggested Refinements:** Actionable advice on how you might improve the trade, such as slightly adjusting your stop loss to a more logical structural level.

### Step 3: Stage & Track Your Signal

After reviewing the AI's feedback and making any desired adjustments, you're ready to monitor the trade.

-   Click the **"Stage Signal & Track"** button at the bottom of the controls panel.
-   This action does two things:
    1.  It saves the complete trade blueprint (including your reasoning and the AI's feedback) to your **AI Signal History** for journaling and later review.
    2.  It launches a **Signal Tracker**, a floating window that stays on top of your screen. This tracker monitors the live price of the asset and shows you in real-time how close it is to your entry, stop loss, and take profit levels.

This workflow transforms a simple idea into a well-defined, AI-validated, and actively tracked trading plan.
