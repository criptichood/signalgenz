# Memes Scalp: High-Octane Degen Trading

**Status: In Development**

The **Memes Scalp** page is a specialized, high-risk, high-reward environment engineered for the fast-paced world of meme coin trading. This interface is stripped down for maximum speed and focuses on providing critical, real-time data for newly launched and trending tokens on the Solana (SOL) and BNB Smart Chain (BSC) ecosystems.

**Warning:** Trading meme coins is extremely risky and can result in a complete loss of funds. This tool is designed for experienced traders who fully understand the dangers of "degen" trading, including the potential for "rug pulls," extreme volatility, and smart contract exploits.

## Core Features (Planned)

### 1. Real-Time Meme Coin Feeds

The heart of the Memes Scalp page will be a dynamic feed of tokens, sourcing data from leading third-party aggregators like DexScreener, Birdeye, and others. You will be able to:

-   **Switch Chains:** Instantly toggle between Solana and BNB Smart Chain feeds.
-   **Sort & Filter:** Organize the feed by `Newest Pairs`, `Trending on Socials`, `Top Volume Movers`, and more.

### 2. AI-Powered "Hype" & Sentiment Analysis

To provide a trading edge, we will leverage the Gemini API to analyze social media sentiment in real-time.

-   **Hype Score:** Each token will feature an AI-generated "Hype Score" based on mentions, engagement, and velocity on platforms like X (Twitter) and Telegram.
-   **Sentiment Alerts:** The AI will detect sudden spikes in social media activity, potentially indicating an imminent pump or a coordinated marketing push.

### 3. Integrated Safety & "Rug Pull" Metrics

Given the risky nature of meme coins, a primary focus of this tool is to provide quick, scannable safety information. The backend will aggregate and display critical on-chain metrics for each token:

-   **Liquidity Status:** Check if liquidity is locked or burned, a key indicator of rug pull risk.
-   **Holder Distribution:** See the percentage of supply held by the top wallets to identify potential for a single entity to dump the price.
-   **Contract Verification:** Confirm if the token's smart contract is verified and if potentially malicious functions (like a `mint` function) are disabled.
-   **Initial Liquidity:** View the amount of initial capital provided, as very low liquidity can lead to extreme price volatility.

### 4. Lightning-Fast Trading Interface

The UI will be optimized for speed and decisiveness.

-   **Simplified Order Panel:** A streamlined interface for placing market buy/sell orders.
-   **One-Click Trading:** Similar to the main Scalping page, enable one-click execution for the fastest possible entries and exits.
-   **Embedded Charting:** A compact, fast-loading chart from an aggregator like DexScreener will be embedded directly into the token's detail view.
