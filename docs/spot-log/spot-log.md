# Spot Log: Your Manual Trading Journal

The **Spot Log** is your personal digital journal for manually recording and tracking all of your spot market trades. By keeping a detailed log, you can analyze your performance, identify patterns in your trading, and build a valuable dataset for future review. This page is a crucial tool for disciplined trading.

## Features Overview

### 1. Performance Stat Cards

At the top of the page, you'll find four key metrics that provide an instant summary of your overall spot trading activity:

-   **Total Invested:** The cumulative US dollar value of all your "Buy" trades.
-   **Total Sold Value:** The cumulative US dollar value of all your "Sell" trades.
-   **Net Invested Capital:** The difference between your total investment and total sold value, showing how much of your capital is currently deployed in the market.
-   **Total Fees Paid:** The sum of all transaction fees you've recorded.

### 2. Logging a New Trade

Click the **"Log New Trade"** button to open a detailed modal where you can record every aspect of your trade:

-   **Core Details:** Set the `Symbol`, `Side` (Buy/Sell), and `Date` of the transaction.
-   **Trade Size:** Enter the `Price` you executed at and the `Total` dollar value of the trade. The `Quantity` of the asset will be calculated for you automatically.
-   **Journaling:** This is where you can turn data into insights.
    -   **Strategy Tags:** Tag your trade with the strategy you used (e.g., "rsi-divergence," "breakout"). This is invaluable for later analysis on the **Analytics** page.
    -   **Chart Screenshot URL:** Add a link to a screenshot of your chart at the time of the trade for visual review.
    -   **Notes / Post-Mortem:** Use the rich-text editor to write down your thoughts. Why did you take this trade? What was your thesis? How did it play out? This is the most important part of any trading journal.

### 3. Managing Your Log

The main table on this page lists all your recorded trades. You can:

-   **Filter and Search:** Use the search bar to find trades for a specific symbol or filter by "Buy" or "Sell" side.
-   **Edit:** Click the action menu (...) on any trade to open the modal and correct or add details.
-   **Delete:** Remove a trade permanently from your log.

### 4. Import & Export

-   **Export:** You can export your entire filtered trade log as a `.json` file. This is useful for creating backups or using your data in external analysis tools.
-   **Import:** If you have a log from another source (or a backup), you can import it as a `.json` file, as long as it matches the application's data structure.
