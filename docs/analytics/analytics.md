# Analytics: Understand Your Trading Edge

The **Analytics** dashboard is your personal data science department, designed to give you a deep and unbiased look into your trading performance. By visualizing the data from your **Spot Log** and **Perpetuals Log**, this page helps you identify your strengths, uncover your weaknesses, and ultimately, find your edge in the market.

## AI Performance Review

This is the centerpiece of the Analytics page. With a single click, you can have the **Google Gemini API** act as your personal trading coach.

-   **How It Works:** When you click "Get AI Review," the application securely sends your recent, anonymized trade history (both spot and perpetuals) to the AI for analysis.
-   **The Insight:** The AI returns a comprehensive, structured report in plain English, broken down into four key sections:
    1.  **Overall Summary:** A high-level take on your trading behavior.
    2.  **Strengths:** What you're doing right (e.g., "excellent win rate on SOL trades," "good at cutting losses quickly").
    3.  **Areas for Improvement:** Constructive criticism on patterns that may be costing you money (e.g., "tendency to over-leverage on losing streaks," "holds losing trades for too long").
    4.  **Actionable Advice:** Specific, concrete steps you can take to improve your results.

## Perpetuals Performance

This section is dedicated to analyzing your leveraged futures trades, where performance metrics are most critical.

### Key Stat Cards

-   **Total Net P/L:** Your bottom line. The total profit or loss from all your closed perpetual trades.
-   **Win Rate:** The percentage of your closed trades that were profitable.
-   **Total Winning/Losing Trades:** A simple count of your wins and losses.

### Performance Charts

-   **Cumulative P/L:** This line chart is one of the most important visuals. It plots the growth (or decline) of your account equity over time as each trade is closed, giving you a clear picture of your overall trajectory.
-   **Win/Loss Ratio:** A simple donut chart that visually represents the distribution of your winning versus losing trades.
-   **P/L by Symbol:** This bar chart breaks down your net profitability for each cryptocurrency you've traded. It instantly shows you which assets are your biggest winners and which ones are your biggest losers, helping you focus your efforts where you perform best.

## Spot Activity

This section provides a summary of your long-term investment or spot trading activities. Since spot trading doesn't involve leverage, the focus is on capital flow rather than P/L percentage.

-   **Total Invested:** The total US dollar value you've spent buying assets.
-   **Total Sold Value:** The total US dollar value you've received from selling assets.
-   **Net Invested Capital:** The difference between the two, showing how much of your capital is currently "in the market."
-   **Total Fees Paid:** The cumulative cost of all your spot transaction fees.
