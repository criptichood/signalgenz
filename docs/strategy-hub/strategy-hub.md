## Creating a New Strategy

You can capture a new strategy at any time by clicking the **"Create Strategy"** button. This opens a modal where you can define your trading plan using a rich-text editor.

### The Strategy Editor

-   **Title:** Give your strategy a clear, memorable name (e.g., "4H Supply/Demand Zone Reversal").
-   **Description:** This is the core of your strategy. Use the rich-text editor to detail every aspect of your plan. Good strategies often include:
    -   **Market Conditions:** The type of market where this strategy works best (e.g., trending, ranging).
    -   **Entry Criteria:** A precise checklist of conditions that must be met to enter a trade.
    -   **Exit Criteria:** Clear rules for taking profit and cutting losses.
    -   **Risk Management:** Your rules for position sizing and leverage.
-   **Tags (comma-separated):** Add keywords to categorize your strategy (e.g., `swing`, `scalping`, `market-structure`, `rsi`). This makes it easy to filter and find later.
-   **Make Public:** A toggle to control the visibility of your strategy.
    -   **Public (On):** The strategy will be visible to other users on your **Profile** page.
    -   **Private (Off):** The strategy is for your eyes only.

## Managing Your Strategies

All of your strategies are displayed as cards in the hub.

### Filtering and Searching

As your library grows, you can easily find what you're looking for:
-   **Search Bar:** Instantly filter strategies by keywords in their title or description.
-   **Tag Filter:** Click on one or more tags to view only the strategies that match those categories.

### Strategy Actions

Each strategy card has an action menu (...) that allows you to:
-   **Edit:** Open the editor to update or refine the strategy.
-   **Share:** Share the strategy directly with another user via a Direct Message.
-   **Delete:** Permanently remove the strategy from your playbook.
