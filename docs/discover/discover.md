# Discover: Find New Traders & Ideas

The **Discover** page is your portal to the wider Signal Gen community. It's designed to help you find interesting content and connect with other traders. This page is divided into two main sections: the "For You" feed and the "Users" directory.

## For You Feed

This is your personalized, algorithmic feed. Unlike a simple chronological list, the "For You" feed scores and ranks posts based on several factors to show you what's most relevant and interesting:

-   **Who You Follow:** Posts from traders you are following are prioritized.
-   **Recency:** Newer posts are given a boost to keep the content fresh.
-   **Engagement:** Posts with more likes and comments are more likely to be shown.
-   **Content-Type:** High-value posts, such as those with an **attached AI Signal** or an **AI-validated Trade Idea**, are given a significant boost in visibility.

This smart sorting ensures you're always seeing a dynamic mix of content from your network and high-quality ideas from across the community.

## Users Directory

Switch to the **"Users"** tab to find and connect with other traders.

-   **Search:** Use the search bar to look for users by their real name or their `@username`.
-   **User Cards:** Search results are displayed as user cards, showing each trader's avatar, name, bio, and a button to quickly **Follow** or **Unfollow** them.
-   **Navigate to Profiles:** Click on any user's name or avatar to navigate directly to their full **Profile** page to see their posts, strategies, and more.
