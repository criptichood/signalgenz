# Profile: Your Trading Identity

The **Profile** page is your personal space within the Signal Gen community. It's where you can share your trade ideas, build a following, and showcase your trading strategies. You can view your own profile or navigate to the profiles of other users to see their content.

## Profile Banner

The top section of the profile provides a summary of the user:

-   **Followers/Following:** See a user's social connections and find new people to follow.

## Content Tabs

The main content of the profile is organized into four tabs, allowing you to explore different facets of a user's activity.

### 1. Posts

This is your primary feed of original content.

-   **Create a Post:** On your own profile, a form appears at the top of this tab. You can write text, attach an image URL, or link to an external site.
-   **Attach Signals & Ideas:** This is a key feature that elevates your posts:
    -   **Attach AI Signal:** After generating a signal on the **Signal Gen** or **Scalping** pages, use the "Share as Post" button. You'll be redirected here with the signal's key details automatically attached to your new post draft.
    -   **Attach Trade Idea:** Use the "Attach Trade Idea" button in the post creator to build your own manual trade setup. You can even get an **AI Second Opinion** on your idea before you post it, which will be displayed alongside your analysis.

### 2. Reposts

This tab shows a feed of posts from other users that you have shared (reposted) with your own followers.

### 3. Likes

This tab displays a feed of all the posts that you have liked, serving as a personal collection of content you found valuable.
