# Trading Calculators: Your Risk Management Toolkit

The **Trading Calculators** page provides a suite of essential tools designed to help you manage risk, plan your trades with precision, and understand the potential outcomes of your positions. Proper risk management is the cornerstone of successful trading, and these calculators are built to make it intuitive and straightforward.

The page is organized into three main tabs, each serving a distinct purpose.

## 1. Position Size Calculator

This is arguably the most important risk management tool for any trader. It answers the fundamental question: *"How much should I buy or sell?"*

-   **Purpose:** To determine the exact position size (quantity of an asset) you should trade to ensure that if your stop loss is hit, you only lose a pre-determined percentage of your account.

### How to Use It

-   **Account Size ($):** Enter the total value of your trading account.
-   **Risk per Trade (%):** Input the maximum percentage of your account you are willing to lose on this single trade. A conservative and common value is 1-2%.
-   **Entry Price:** The price at which you plan to enter the trade.
-   **Stop Loss Price:** The price at which you will exit the trade for a loss.

### The Results

The calculator will instantly provide you with three critical pieces of information:

-   **Risk Amount ($):** The exact dollar amount you will lose if your stop loss is hit.
-   **Position Value ($):** The total value of the position you should take.
-   **Quantity / Shares:** The precise amount of the asset you should buy or sell.

## 2. Leverage Calculator

This calculator helps you understand the impact of leverage on your potential profits and losses, and it provides a crucial estimate of your liquidation price.

-   **Purpose:** To quickly calculate the potential P/L of a leveraged trade and to be aware of the price at which your position would be liquidated.

### How to Use It

-   **Position:** Select whether you are going `Long` or `Short`.
-   **Capital ($):** Enter the amount of margin you are allocating to the trade.
-   **Entry Price:** Your planned entry price.
-   **Exit Price:** Your planned take-profit or stop-loss price.
-   **Leverage (x):** The leverage multiplier you are using (e.g., 25x).

### The Results

-   **Profit / Loss:** Shows your potential profit or loss in both a dollar amount and a percentage of your margin.
-   **Est. Liquidation Price:** An estimated price at which the exchange would automatically close your position to prevent further losses. **Note:** This is an estimate and does not account for fees or maintenance margin.

## 3. Risk/Reward Calculator

This is an advanced, all-in-one trade planning tool that helps you visualize the entire structure of a potential trade, from risk management to profit targets.

-   **Purpose:** To calculate the risk-to-reward ratio of a trade and see potential profit outcomes at various levels.

### How to Use It

This calculator is more detailed, allowing for both **Isolated** and **Cross** margin calculations.

-   **Margin Mode:** Choose your margin type.
-   **Capital & Risk:** Define your capital and risk, either as a percentage or a fixed dollar amount.
-   **Trade Levels:** Input your `Entry Price` and `Stop-Loss Price`.
-   **Leverage & Position:** Set your desired `Leverage` and `Position` type (Long/Short).

### The Results

The output is a comprehensive trade blueprint:

-   **Core Metrics:** Instantly see your required `Margin`, total `Position Size`, `Potential Loss` at your stop loss, and the estimated `Liquidation Price`.
-   **Safety Analysis:** A unique feature that warns you if your stop loss is dangerously close to your liquidation price, providing recommendations on how to create a safer buffer.
-   **Take Profit Targets:** A detailed table showing multiple profit targets based on standard risk-to-reward ratios (e.g., 1:1, 1:2, 1:3 R:R). For each target, it calculates the required `Exit Price`, the `Profit` in dollars, and the `Return on Equity (ROE %)` for your margin.
