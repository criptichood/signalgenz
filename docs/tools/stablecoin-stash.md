# Stablecoin Stash: On-Chain Monitoring

The **Stablecoin Stash** is a powerful tool designed to give you a clear, consolidated view of your stablecoin holdings across multiple cryptocurrency wallets. Instead of just being a manual log, this feature now provides live, on-chain monitoring, allowing you to track your "dry powder" or savings without compromising security.

**Security First:** This is a **read-only** tool. You only provide your public wallet address. The application never asks for your private keys or seed phrase, ensuring your funds remain completely secure and under your control.

## Features Overview

### 1. Adding a Wallet

To start tracking, simply click the **"Add Wallet"** button. You will be prompted to provide:
-   **Wallet Address:** The public address of your Ethereum wallet (e.g., `0x...`).
-   **Wallet Label (Optional):** A custom name to easily identify the wallet (e.g., "My Savings," "DeFi Wallet").

Once added, the application will query the blockchain to find the balances of major stablecoins (`USDC`, `USDT`, `DAI`) held by that address.

### 2. Dashboard View

Your Stash dashboard provides a high-level summary of all your tracked holdings:
-   **Total Stablecoin Value:** The combined US dollar value of all stablecoins across all your wallets.
-   **Wallets Tracked:** The total number of wallets you are currently monitoring.
-   **Dominant Stablecoin:** The stablecoin that makes up the largest portion of your total holdings.

### 3. Tracked Wallets List

Each wallet you add appears as a detailed card, showing:
-   The wallet's label and formatted address.
-   The total stablecoin value within that specific wallet.
-   A detailed breakdown of each stablecoin, including its icon, name, balance, and current USD value.

### 4. Portfolio Breakdown

A visual pie chart on the right gives you an instant understanding of your overall stablecoin allocation. It shows the percentage distribution of your holdings (e.g., 50% USDC, 30% USDT, 20% DAI), helping you manage your portfolio's composition.
