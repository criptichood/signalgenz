# AI Assistant: Your Intelligent Trading Co-Pilot

The AI Assistant, powered by Google's Gemini, is a sophisticated chatbot integrated throughout the Signal Gen application. It's more than just a help bot; it's a context-aware co-pilot designed to answer your questions, explain complex topics, and even perform actions within the app on your command.

You can access the assistant at any time by clicking the floating chat icon.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Context-Aware Guidance

The AI Assistant understands where you are in the application. If you're on the **Scalping** page viewing a signal for `ETHUSDT` and ask, *"What's the risk on this trade?"*, the assistant will use the data from the active signal card on your screen to perform the calculation and give you a precise answer. This contextual awareness makes it an incredibly powerful tool for real-time analysis.

### 2. Trading Educator

Struggling with a trading concept mentioned in an AI's analysis? Just ask the assistant.

-   *"What is a Fair Value Gap?"*
-   *"Explain market structure to me."*
-   *"What does 'liquidity sweep' mean?"*

The AI will provide clear, educational explanations to help you learn and grow as a trader. For general learning, it may also guide you to the **Tutorials** page.

### 3. Application Navigator

The assistant can help you find your way around the app. When it mentions a specific feature, it will often provide a clickable link to take you directly to that page.
