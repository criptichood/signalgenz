# Messages: Direct & Private Conversations

The **Messages** page provides a secure and private direct messaging (DM) system, allowing you to have one-on-one conversations with other traders in the Signal Gen community.

## Interface Overview

The messaging interface is a classic two-pane layout designed for intuitive navigation:

1.  **Conversation List (Left):** This panel displays a list of all your ongoing conversations, sorted by the most recent message. Each item shows the other user's profile picture, name, and a preview of the last message sent. A blue dot indicates an unread message.
2.  **Active Chat View (Right):** When you select a conversation, this panel opens up to show the full message history. Your messages appear on the right, and the other user's messages appear on the left.

## How to Use Messages

-   **Starting a Conversation:** You can initiate a new conversation by navigating to another user's **Profile** and clicking the "Message" button. This will automatically create a new conversation thread and take you to the Messages page.
-   **Sending Messages:** At the bottom of the active chat view, you'll find a text input field. Type your message and press Enter or click the send button to send it.
-   **Sharing Posts:** You can share any post from your feed or a user's profile via DM. Click the "Share" button on a post and select "Share via DM." This will prompt you to choose a user, and it will send them a link to the post in your conversation.
-   **Notifications:** When you receive a new message, a notification badge will appear on the bell icon in the main header and on the "Messages" link in the sidebar, ensuring you never miss a conversation.
